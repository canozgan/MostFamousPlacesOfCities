# MostFamousPlacesOfCities
This project is an application developed for android phones with a minimum SDK of 24. This application is written in Java. The purpose of this application is for
tourists to learn about famous places in the cities they visit for the first time. Users can mark the locations of their favorite places they have visited before
on the map, post pictures and write their own comments and share it for other users to see. A person who goes to that city for the first time can search for the 
name of the relevant city and discover the famous places of that city and view its location on the map. If he clicks on the Marker, an arrow will appear below to 
switch to Google Maps. When he clicks there, he can go to Google Maps with the relevant location and learn how to get there.

During the development of this project, Google Maps Api Key was used. The firebase platform provided by Google was used as the database. Authentication, Firestore 
Database and Storage modules on this platform are used. Authentication module is used during registration of users. Firestore Database and Storage modules are used 
to store users' posts in the database. Recycler view technology, which is a Jetpack element, is used while listing the results when users search.

When the application is first opened, users must sign in with their email addresses and passwords.If they are using it for the first time, they can sign up from this 
page. After log in, they can see the previous posts about that city by typing the name of the relevant city. They can view that place on the map by clicking the 
Show On Map button. They can even learn how to go to that place by switching to the Google Maps application with the relevant location, as described above. They can 
click on Share New Place from the menu and reopen the map. The map will start from their current location. They can put markers at the desired location by long 
clicking. They can click on the Share This Location button and go to the other page and post a photo of the relevant location ,write their comments. By clicking 
the Share button, they can make these posts visible to other users.
